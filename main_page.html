  <div class="our-story"><h2 id="our-story"> Our Story</h2><br /><p> Planet Express, Inc. is an intergalactic delivery company owned and operated by Professor Farnsworth to fund his research. Founded in 2961, its headquarters is located in New New York, and its crew includes many important characters of the series. The current crew reached their 100th delivery in September 3010, and to celebrate, Bender threw a 100th-delivery party. The inaugural delivery crew, which disappeared on its first interplanetary mission, was found alive in June 3011.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ze1A68P.png" class="our_team"></div><br />
